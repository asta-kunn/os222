this website usefull for people want to try competitive programming with C lang or ect lang

## Week 05
1. [Operation System - Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm) 
The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory.
2. [RAM in Linux](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-check-ram-in-linux)
The RAM (Random Access Memory) is an essential component of a Linux system which has to be monitored closely. In some conditions, we may run out of memory with very slow response times to our server or completely unresponsive.

## Week 06
1. [Process and Threads in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITc09gOrqZk)<br>
This video explains the distinction between processes and threads using examples from everyday life. I frequently struggle with understanding this subject, but after viewing this video, you should have no trouble answering the questions.

2. [Single-threaded and Multi-threaded Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes)<br>
Single-threaded processes only carry out one set of instructions at a time. In other words, each command is handled separately. Multithreaded processes are the opposite of single-threaded processes. These procedures enable the concurrent execution of numerous program components. These are the available, light operations in the process.

3. [All You Need To Know About Processes in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-process-management/)<br>
A program in execution is referred to as a process; it is a running instance of a program. A process usually starts a new one when it produces an identical replica of itself in memory. The sole difference between the child process' environment and that of its parent is the process ID number. The first program launched when a Linux system boots is the Init process, which is the mother (parent) of all processes on the system.

4. [fork in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)
One of the crucial concepts you need to understand in the Operating system course is the fork system call. A new process known as a "child process" is created with the fork system function and runs simultaneously with the process that invoked fork() (parent process).

## Week 07

1. [Process Synchronization in Operating System](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5460/slides/Lecture07.pdf)<br>
The fundamental principles of most synchronization are as follows: Make one of the threads, processes, interrupt handlers, etc. hold until it is safe to continue if two of them are about to have conflicting accesses.

2. [Critical Section in Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/)<br>
The term "critical section" refers to a code segment that is accessed by several programs. The shared variables or resources in the critical section must be synchronized in order to ensure the consistency of the data variable.

3. [Difference between Mutex and Semaphore in Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system)<br>
A resource access can be synchronized using mutex, a mutual exclusion object. A program is given a special name right away. A semaphore is a signaling device after that. You may learn about mutex and semaphore differences by reading this webpage. To help you comprehend mutex and semaphore better, they also provide a simple example.

4. [Deadlock Prevention And Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
Deadlock is a situation where a group (or more) of processes are unable to finish because they are each holding resources that the other processes require. It will become a cyclic wait in this circumstance.

# Week 08

1. [What is Linux From Scratch?](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/)<br>
This page site will explain why we need to build linux from scratch. After read this page, I a bit unsterstand why we need to do that.

2. [INSTALLING LINUX FROM SCRATCH](https://youtu.be/S7N9D4IqHA0)<br>
This is an amazing video. This video will definitely give you an idea of what will you face during the installation od linux from scratch.

3. [Linux From Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch)<br>
Linux From Scratch is a way to install a working Linux system by building all components of it manually. This is, naturally, a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. According to the Linux From Scratch site, the advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.
